== L104372 - Exposing data as services in a microservices architecture on OpenShift documentation
In this hands-on lab, youâ€™ll learn how to expose data as services in a Microservices Architecture running on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP). See how to transform a microservices application to use data services instead of connecting directly to the underlying datasource. 
In this lab, you'll learn how to use to: 

* Quickly develop a basic container-based application 
* Reuse container images from the Red Hat container registry 
* Migrate a simple microservices application to a containerized version using data services to connect to the underlying data sources
* Get a feel for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)

You'll also learn what tools to consider when implementing a containerized, microservices architecture.

== Audience/Intro/Prerequisites:
This lab is geared towards developers who are interested in learning how to containerize their data applications. Attendees, during this session, will explore Microservice architecture, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization and Red Hat JBoss Data Grid. To accomplish this, one need a little background or experience in Linux.  

Here you can find the https://cvanball.gitbooks.io/L104372/content/[L104372 - Exposing data as services in a microservices architecture on OpenShift book].

== Generate html/pdf/epub/mobi 

You may locally create rendered forms of the documentation. To do this install https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook[gitbook] and https://help.gitbook.com/build/ebookconvert.html[ebook-convert], then execute the following commands from the checkout location:

----
$ gitbook build ./ L104372
$ gitbook pdf ./L104372 L104372.pdf
$ gitbook epub ./L104372 L104372.epub
$ gitbook mobi ./L104372 L104372.mobi
----

Once above commands executes successfully, the `L104372` folder, `L104372.pdf`, `L104372.epub`, and `L104372.mobi` will be generated.
