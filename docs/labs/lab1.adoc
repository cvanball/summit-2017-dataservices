== Lab 1 - Docker Refresh (optional)

image:images/logo_docker.png[images/logo_docker.png]

In this lab we will explore the docker environment within Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. If you are familiar with docker this may function as a brief refresher or proceed with Lab 2. If you are new to docker this will serve as an introduction to docker basics. Don't worry, we will progress rapidly. To get through this lab, we are going to focus on the environment itself as well as walk through some exercises with a couple of Docker images / containers to tell a complete story and point out some things that you might have to consider when containerizing your application.

This lab should be performed on *the machine in front* of you unless otherwise instructed.

The machine should have been brought up in lab. 
You can access that machine using username _student_ and password _student_

Expected completion: 15 minutes

Topics:

* Review Docker and systemd
* Review Docker help
* Explore a Dockerfile
* Build an image
* Launch a container
* Inspect a container


=== Docker and systemd
Check out the systemd unit file that starts Docker on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and notice that it includes 3 Environment Files. These files tell Docker how the Docker daemon, storage and networking should be set up and configured. Take a look at those files too. Specifically, in the /etc/sysconfig/docker file check out the registry settings. You may find it interesting that you can ADD_REGISTRY and BLOCK_REGISTRY. Think about the different use cases for that.

Perform the following commands as root unless instructed otherwise.

[source,bash]
----
[student@localhost ~]$ cat /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service
[student@localhost ~]$ cat /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker-storage-setup.service
[student@localhost ~]$ cat /etc/sysconfig/docker
[student@localhost ~]$ cat /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage
[student@localhost ~]$ cat /etc/sysconfig/docker-network
----

Now check the status of docker and make sure it is running before moving forward.
It should have been brought up automatically for us by the OCP environment.

[source,bash]

=== Docker Help
Now that we see how the Docker startup process works, we should make sure we know how to get help when we need it.  Run the following commands to get familiar with what is included in the Docker package as well as what is provided in the man pages. Spend some time exploring here. When you run docker info check out the storage configuration. The CDK automatically sets up storage for us by creating an LVM thin pool for use as a device mapper direct docker storage backend.

Check out the executables provided:

[source,bash]

=== Lets explore a Dockerfile

As a part of the Red Hat Software Collections offering, Red Hat provides a number of container images, which are based on the corresponding Software Collections. These include application, daemon, and database images. Here you can see in the FROM command that we are pulling a Apache Web Server base image based on RHEL 7.3 that we are going to use in this example. Containers that are being built inherit the subscriptions of the host they are running on, so you only need to register the host system. Here we are just going to explore a simple Dockerfile. The purpose for this is to have a look at some of the basic commands that are used to construct a Docker image. For this lab, we will explore a basic Apache Dockerfile and then confirm functionality.

As the student user, change directory to ~/summit-2017-dataservices/labs/lab1/ and cat out the Dockerfile

[source,bash]
----
[student@localhost ~]$ cd ~/summit-2017-dataservices/labs/lab1
[student@localhost lab1]$ cat Dockerfile
# Pull the rhel image from the local repository
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7
MAINTAINER Student <student@foo.io>

USER root

EXPOSE 80
----

After gaining access to a repository, we EXPOSE port 80, which allows traffic into the container, and then set the container to start.  

=== Build an Image

Now that we have taken a look at the Dockerfile, lets build this image. Since it was already built previously the image is retrieved from the cache.

[source,bash]
----
[student@localhost lab1]$ docker build -t redhat/apache .
Sending build context to Docker daemon 2.048 kB
Step 1 : FROM registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7
 ---> 533e496998ca
Step 2 : MAINTAINER Student <student@foo.io>
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 2421ced729fb
Step 3 : USER root
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 0fd493ddbb4a
Step 4 : EXPOSE 80
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 3ce031e2bbc5

----

=== Run the Container

Next, lets run the image and make sure it started.

[source,bash]
----
[student@localhost lab1]$ docker run -dt -p 81:80 --name apache redhat/apache

----

Here we are using a few switches to configure the running container the way we want it. We are running a -dt to run in detached mode with a pseudo TTY. Next we are mapping a port from the host to the container. We are being explicit here. We have told  Docker to map port 81 on the host to port 80 in the container. Now, we could have let Docker handle the host side port mapping dynamically by passing a -P or -p 80, in which case Docker would have randomly assigned a port to the container. Finally, we passed in the name of the image that we built earlier.

Okay, lets make sure we can access the web server.

[source,bash]
----
[student@localhost lab1]$ curl http://localhost:81
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd\">

	<head>
		<title>Test Page for the Apache HTTP Server on Red Hat Enterprise Linux</title>
.....
----

Start Firefox Web Browser using Applications→Favorites→Firefox Web Browser and point the URL to http://localhost:81 and should see a similar screen as depicted below

image:images/lab1-test-page.png[images/lab1-test-page.png]

Now that we have built an image, launched a container and confirmed that it is running, let\'s do some further inspection of the container. We should take a look at the container IP address. Let\'s use docker inspect to do that.

=== Time to Inspect

[source,bash]
----
[student@localhost lab1]$ docker inspect apache
----

We can see that this gives us quite a bit of information in json format. We can scroll around and find the IP address, it will be towards the bottom.

[source,bash]
----
	"Networks": {
            	"bridge": {
                	"IPAMConfig": null,
                	"Links": null,
                	"Aliases": null,
                	"NetworkID": "4c6c77ea7038a36ca39f11d4cfb80cb0e502d975f87d33ba47bccccd0c6c168d",
                	"EndpointID": "251efeefa42411516842d8d4ca230759d8a63ef6c670a15bc4f4e0ef3faa95ce",
                	"Gateway": "172.17.0.1",
                	"IPAddress": "172.17.0.3",
                	"IPPrefixLen": 16,
                	"IPv6Gateway": "",
                	"GlobalIPv6Address": "",
                	"GlobalIPv6PrefixLen": 0,
                	"MacAddress": "02:42:ac:11:00:03"
            	}
        	}
----

Let\'s be more explicit with our docker inspect

[source,bash]
----
[student@localhost lab1]$ docker inspect --format '\{\{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress \}\}' apache
172.17.0.3
----

You should see the IP address that was assigned to the container. 

We can apply the same filter to any value in the json output. Try a few different ones.

Now lets look inside the container and see what that environment looks like. We first need to get the PID of the container so we can attach to the PID namespace with nsenter. After we have the PID, go ahead and enter the namespaces of the container substituting the PID on your container for the one listed below. Take a look at the man page to understand all the flags we are passing to nsenter.

[source,bash]
----
[student@localhost lab1]$ docker inspect --format '\{\{ .State.Pid \}\}' apache
15860

[student@localhost lab1]$ man nsenter
NAME
   	nsenter - run program with namespaces of other processes
…...

[student@localhost lab1]$ sudo nsenter -m -u -n -i -p -t 15860
[sudo] password for student:
[root@e9e06e014a73 /]#
----

Now run some commands and explore the environment. Remember, we are in a slimmed down container at this point - this is by design. You may find yourself restricted.

[source,bash]
----

Well, what can we do?  You can install software into this container.

----

Exit the container namespace with CTRL+d or exit.

In addition to using nsenter to enter the namespace of your container, you can also execute commands in that namespace with docker exec.

[source,bash]
----
$ docker exec <container-name OR container-id> <cmd>
[student@localhost lab1]$ docker exec apache pwd
/opt/app-root/src
----

Whew, so we do have some options. Now, remember that this lab is all about containerizing your existing apps. You will need some of the tools listed above to go through the process of containerizing your apps. Troubleshooting problems when you are in a container is going to be something that you get very familiar with.

Before we move on to the next section let\'s clean up the apache container so we don\'t have it hanging around.

[source,bash]
----
[student@localhost lab1]$ docker rm -f apache
Apache
[student@localhost lab1]$ cd $HOME
[student@localhost ~]$
----

==== Congratulations!!!!! You have completed this lab.
