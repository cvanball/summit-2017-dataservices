== Introduction

Before we jump into the demo and see how OpenShift can support a polyglot microservice system based on many different services, letâ€™s spend some time talking about the architecture of the demo application and the components the demo is using. 

=== Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) v3 is a layered system designed to expose underlying Docker-formatted container image and Kubernetes concepts as accurately as possible, with a focus on easy composition of applications by a developer. For example, install Ruby, push code, and add MySQL.

The concept of an application as a separate object is removed in favor of more flexible composition of "services", allowing two web containers to reuse a database or expose a database directly to the edge of the network.

The Docker service provides the abstraction for packaging and creating Linux-based, lightweight container images. Kubernetes provides the cluster management and orchestrates containers on multiple hosts.
OCP adds:
* Source code management, builds, and deployments for developers
* Managing and promoting images at scale as they flow through your system
* Application management at scale
* Team and user tracking for organizing a large developer organization
